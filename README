This is the second iteration of my button project.
The goal of the project is to create an interactive
system that displays a countdown for our current
sales goal of 20 contracts. 

The system is made up of a Raspberry Pi and a
Button. The RPi hosts a webserver capable of
serving websockets and hosts a web page that uses
a websocket for communication between a client
(someone viewing the countdown) and the RPi which
is also monitoring for Button presses. The count
is decremented on each button press and a message
is sent to all clients with the new "count" to be
displayed.
